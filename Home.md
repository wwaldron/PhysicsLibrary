## Welcome

Welcome to [[Will Waldron|Dr. Will Waldron's]] Physics Library. This is a repository of anything that is related to Physics (specifically the classes he teaches). It is not meant to be a replacement of a textbook. Instead, this is a repository of atomic thoughts[^1] designed to help you link concepts from your Physics classes.

## Getting Started

As it's difficult to know where to begin your study of Physics, it's also difficult to know where to begin directing you in that matter. One place to begin is answering the question [[What is Physics]].

[^1]: My hope is that each file is bite-sized to better help you grasp it.
