# What is Physics

The [Merriam-Webster Dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/physics) defines Physics as "a [[What is Science|science]] that deals with [[What is Matter|matter]] and [[What is Energy|energy]] and their interactions."

This is a reasonable definition and there's no need to change it. However, I do like to tell those who ask that Physics is "**the study of *how* and *why* [[The Universe|the Universe]] is the way it is**."
